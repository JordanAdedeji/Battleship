# Battleship

# Battleship Project By DFJAAB
The purpose of our project was to learn a new coding language. We worked as a team of 6 to learn and develop a working Battleship game in swift using Xcode.
Our project is a two player game which will allow players to place their ships on a 8*8 board with 10 ships.

# Features Of Game
Placing of Ships Hitting & missing Ships Switching between players views Sound effects Animation sliding bar

# Installation Requirements
BattleShips can be run by installing XCODE and running the iPhone simulator or downloaded onto a apple device.
