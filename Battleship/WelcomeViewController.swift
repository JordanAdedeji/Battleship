The other player's ships are somewhere on his/her board; you must try and hit them by clicking on one of the squares on the board, if an enemy ship is hidden in that square you score a hit!  If you score a hit you get another shot, if you miss, it's the other player's turn.  The other player tries to hit your ships when it's their turn.  Neither you nor the other player can see the other's board so you must try to guess where they are. Good luck, and thank you for playing our game.", preferredStyle: .actionSheet)
